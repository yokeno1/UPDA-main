### Abstract

While no-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) approaches have achieved significant progress over the past decade, their performance often degrades substantially when a distribution gap exists between the training (source domain) and testing (target domain) data. 
However, to date, limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains.
To address this challenge, we propose the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for NR-PCQA, which establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment paradigm. 
At the coarse-grained stage, a discrepancy-based coarse-grained ranking alignment method is designed to capture relative quality relationships between cross-domain samples through a combined ranking loss and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss, circumventing the challenges of direct absolute feature alignment. 
At the fine-grained stage,  an adversarial-based fine-grained fusion alignment approach with cross-attention mechanism is developed to identify domain-invariant features, while a conditional discriminator selectively enhances quality-relevant feature transfer.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPDA effectively enhances the performance of NR-PCQA methods in cross-domain scenarios, validating its practical applicability.
